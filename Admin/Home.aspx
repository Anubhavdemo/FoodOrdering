                   Vegetables are parts of plants that are 
                   consumed by humans or other animals as food. 
                   The original meaning is still commonly used and is
                   applied to plants collectively to refer to all edible plant matter, 
                   including the flowers, fruits, stems, leaves, roots, and seeds.

                  Leaf vegetables, also called leafy greens,
                   salad greens, pot herbs, vegetable greens, or
                   simply greens, are plant leaves eaten as a vegetable,
                   sometimes accompanied by tender petioles and shoots. 
                   Although they come from a very wide variety of plants, most share
                   a great deal with other leaf vegetables in nutrition and cooking methods.

                   Root vegetables are generally storage organs,
                   enlarged to store energy in the form of carbohydrates. 
                   They differ in the concentration and the balance among starches, 
                   sugars, and other types of carbohydrate. Of particular

                   starchy root vegetables are important staple foods,
